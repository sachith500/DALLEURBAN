# DALLEURBAN
Repository for papers, datasets and methods for automated imagery generation for the built environment.

Our first paper DALLEURBAN is now accepted!

The DALLEURBAN dataset generated by DALLE-2 can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/126tJOGeu2xw5Dzrs_FneUeMPVj2z9IKP?usp=sharing).
Stable Diffusion dataset can be found [here](https://mediaflux.researchsoftware.unimelb.edu.au:443/mflux/share.mfjp?_token=9OgdI7JnaOzeWYIx9w641128224286&browser=true&filename=DALLEURBAN_dataset.zip).

To identify the prompt used to generate an image using Stable Diffusion simple do the following. First lookup the filename on the image, divide it by 2 and that's the line number in the text file which contains the prompt for that image.
